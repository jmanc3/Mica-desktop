## Installation

You can install Mylar wherever there is a stable Hyprland package for your system.

```bash
yay -S mylardesktop
```

Or, if you already have Hyprand, you can install it as a [plugin]() instead.

In your login manager you should now see an option `Mylardesktop via USWM`. Select that and login.

## Manually building plugin

First install build dependencies

```
sudo pacman -S git gcc cmake make pkg-config pango cairo librsvg libxkbcommon dbus
```

Download the latest Mylardesktop release 0.2.0 (for Hyprland 0.51.0) and unzip it (or untar it), and enter the folder.

```
cd Mylardesktop
make release
```

That will generate `mylar-desktop.so` inside of the `out` folder.

Now you can load the plugin on Hyprland by running `hyprctl plugin load /full/path/to/mylar-desktop.so`. To automatically run the plugin when Hyprland starts, Modify `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`, and add `exec-once = hyprland plugin load /full/path/to/mylar-desktop.so` somewhere.
